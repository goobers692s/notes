- "Today's programming wisdom is to write code that is easy to understand and maintain. This means using clear and descriptive variable names, writing concise and well-structured functions, and commenting your code thoroughly. Remember, code is read more often than it is written, so make it easy for others (and your future self) to read and understand."
