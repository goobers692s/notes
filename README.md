- Today's programming wisdom is to prioritize tasks, plan ahead, and stay organized. This will help you to be more efficient and productive in your coding endeavors. First, prioritize your tasks based on their importance and deadlines. By giving priority to the tasks that need to get done first, you can ensure that you are making progress on the right things.

Second, planning ahead is crucial for success. Before starting a new project or undertaking a large task, take the time to plan out your approach. Break the project down into smaller, manageable chunks, assign deadlines to each chunk, then start working on them one by one. Planning ahead will ensure you have a clear roadmap and won't get lost in the details. 
 最终，保持组织是提高编程效率的关键。使用版本控制系统（如Git）来管理你的代码，确保你的项目结构清晰，使用注释来解释复杂的逻辑和函数。这将使你的工作更加高效，因为你可以轻松地找到和修改代码。
总之，今天的智慧是优先处理任务，提前计划并保持组织。这些策略将帮助你更高效地编写代码并提高生产力。
